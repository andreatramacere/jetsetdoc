Version 1.2.1
=============

New features
------------

- Introduction of depending pars: model parameters can be linked via functional dependence.  See this section of the user guide  :ref:`depending_parameters`


- Temporal Evolution: the python interface to perform self-consistent temporal evolution of leptonic emitters under acceleration and cooling has been added. See this section of the user guide  :ref:`temp_ev`

- Hadronic pp emission: the python interface to perform self-consistent temporal evolution of leptonic emitters under acceleration and cooling has been added. See this section of the user guide  :ref:`hadronic_pp_jet_guide`


- Theoretical background for SSC model: a detailed explanation of the theoretical background for SSC/EC model has been added. See this section of the user guide  :ref:`ssc_th_bkg`


- Emitters distributions: the emitters distribution class has be improved. See this section of the user guide  :ref:`custom_emitters_guide`

- EBL absorption: linking of parameters has been updated See this section of the user guide  :ref:`ebl_model`


- Plugins:
